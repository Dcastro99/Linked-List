# Hashtables

## Challenge

- set
  - Arguments: key, value
  - Returns: nothing
  - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
  - Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.
- get
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
- has
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
- keys
  - Returns: Collection of keys
- hash
  - Arguments: key
  - Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Approach & Efficiency

Used javascript and we are using nested loops in order to traverse through th e array and nested arrays and return the key.
